# creative-embedded-systems-final

Included in this repository is the code and necessary files to recreate my final project for the Creative Embedded Systems course at Columbia University. The idea is an interactive fish sculpture and a website to interact through.

The code included here are HTML, php, and JavaScript files to control the website. Also there is Arduino c++ code to control 2 servo motors through an ESP32 with TTGO display and interpret JSON messages sent from the website.
