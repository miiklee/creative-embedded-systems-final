"Clown Fish:

Clown fish are saltwater fish that live in coral reefs around the world.
They gained popularity after their starring role in the 2003 film Finding Nemo.
While they--as all fish--swim at a variety of speeds, Clown fish on average swim 3
miles per hour--thats about 4.4 feet per second, or at a burst of speed, can reach 
up to 18 miles per hour!"


"Salmon:

Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in both fresh and salt water. While they
are born in freshwater streams, they spend most of their life at sea, only returning
to the freshwater when it's time to make baby salmons. They swim at speeds around 3.4
feet per second, and are also well known for their popularity with the dining services
in charge of Faculty house."

"Pufferfish:

Pufferfish are saltwater fish living in tropical areas. They are among the slowest swimmers
on our list--at 2 feet per second--as their adaptations do not lend themselves well to speed. 
Instead of swimming quickly to escape predators, their odd shape and poisonous spines scare
away would be predators. They are also able inflate themselves as a defense mechanism
and giving them their name."

"Koi Fish:

Often known for their presence in ornamental ponds, koi are cold water fish bred by japanese
farmers for their striking colors. While they were originally intended as food, they are now 
purely decorative. They swim at about 3.6 feet per second...but mostly in circles since they do
not tend to be out in the wild."

"Anchovies:

Anchovies are small saltwater fish, which--according to google--people put on pizza sometimes.
This sounds like a terrible idea to me, but humans are idiots, so it is not surprising. They are
small and swim in packs. They swim 5 body lengths per second, which is approximately 1 foot per second, 
however, to account for the size of the model fish, it is moving at 3 ft/s which is equivalent to its
body length (7") times 5."

"Sharks:

Contrary to the argument my roommates and I got into when making this list, sharks are in fact fish.
I'm not sure what else they would be, but I don't buy the concept of them being fish... they should
be their own thing. However, they are in fact fish and are as such included here. There are many varieties
of sharks, but I used a Great White Shark as the basis for this project. They swim at 11.7 feet per second
and can in fact never stop swimming or they will sink to the bottom of the ocean."

"Guppies:

Guppies are popular in aquariums because they are pretty. However, the are indigenous to saltwater habitats
in South America. They have also been distributed into habitats around the world to help control mosquito 
populations... this has been bad though because they have in turn destroyed native fish populations. 
Guppies are the colonizers of the fish world, and as such, their useless-ness transfers into their swimming
speeds, a mere 1.8 feet per second. This website is officially a guppy hate page. Thank you for coming to my 
TED Talk."
